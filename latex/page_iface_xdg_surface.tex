An interface that may be implemented by a wl\+\_\+surface, for implementations that provide a desktop-\/style user interface.

It provides a base set of functionality required to construct user interface elements requiring management by the compositor, such as toplevel windows, menus, etc. The types of functionality are split into xdg\+\_\+surface roles.

Creating an xdg\+\_\+surface does not set the role for a wl\+\_\+surface. In order to map an xdg\+\_\+surface, the client must create a role-\/specific object using, e.\+g., get\+\_\+toplevel, get\+\_\+popup. The wl\+\_\+surface for any given xdg\+\_\+surface can have at most one role, and may not be assigned any role not based on xdg\+\_\+surface.

A role must be assigned before any other requests are made to the xdg\+\_\+surface object.

The client must call wl\+\_\+surface.\+commit on the corresponding wl\+\_\+surface for the xdg\+\_\+surface state to take effect.

Creating an xdg\+\_\+surface from a wl\+\_\+surface which has a buffer attached or committed is a client error, and any attempts by a client to attach or manipulate a buffer prior to the first xdg\+\_\+surface.\+configure call must also be treated as errors.

After creating a role-\/specific object and setting it up (e.\+g. by sending the title, app ID, size constraints, parent, etc), the client must perform an initial commit without any buffer attached. The compositor will reply with initial wl\+\_\+surface state such as wl\+\_\+surface.\+preferred\+\_\+buffer\+\_\+scale followed by an xdg\+\_\+surface.\+configure event. The client must acknowledge it and is then allowed to attach a buffer to map the surface.

Mapping an xdg\+\_\+surface-\/based role surface is defined as making it possible for the surface to be shown by the compositor. Note that a mapped surface is not guaranteed to be visible once it is mapped.

For an xdg\+\_\+surface to be mapped by the compositor, the following conditions must be met\+: (1) the client has assigned an xdg\+\_\+surface-\/based role to the surface (2) the client has set and committed the xdg\+\_\+surface state and the role-\/dependent state to the surface (3) the client has committed a buffer to the surface

A newly-\/unmapped surface is considered to have met condition (1) out of the 3 required conditions for mapping a surface if its role surface has not been destroyed, i.\+e. the client must perform the initial commit again before attaching a buffer. \hypertarget{page_iface_xdg_surface_page_iface_xdg_surface_api}{}\doxysubsection{\texorpdfstring{API}{API}}\label{page_iface_xdg_surface_page_iface_xdg_surface_api}
